5870|Ooh-woah
9370|Oh-oh
16870|Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
19370|But the very next day, you gave it away
24370|This year, to save me from tears
29370|I'll give it to someone special
35870|Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
39370|But the very next day, you gave it away
44370|This year, to save me from tears
49370|I'll give it to someone special

73870|I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
78870|Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
83870|Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
89870|(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
94870|With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
99870|Now I know what a fool I've been
104870|But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
111870|Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

140000|Oh
146000|Oh, my baby
148000|Ooh
161870|A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
164370|I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
168870|My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
171870|Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
177870|A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
183370|A man undercover, but you tore him apart
188870|Ooh-ooh
191870|Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

217370|I'll give it to someone special
225370|A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
230870|A man undercover, but you tore him apart
236370|Maybe next year
240870|I'll give it to someone special
